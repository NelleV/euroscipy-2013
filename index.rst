Python for Education and Scientific Computing
===============================================================================

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open source, extensible
programming language. It combines clarity and readability, making it an
extremely powerful language that can be used for various applications and
problems.

Python is simple and easy to learn and apply. It offers an interactive
environment in which to explore procedural, functional and object oriented
approaches to problem solving. Its high level data structures, extensive
documentation and clear syntax make it an ideal first language, while the large
number of existing libraries make it suitable to tackle almost any programming
tasks. Its simplicity makes it easy to adapt to multiple educational domains.

Python has several libraries that enable numeric and symbolic computing. It
also interfaces well with native codes in C,C++ and FORTRAN and has excellent
libraries for plotting/visualization. Python also provides libraries for
general purpose computing including generating user interfaces and web
development. These coupled with it's interactive interpreter make Python an
excellent language for Scientific Computing.

All these features when combined with their wide-ranging applications make
Python a perfect fit for use in Education, Industry and Scientific Computing.
